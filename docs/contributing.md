## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a Code of Conduct that all contributors are expected to follow. By participating, you agree to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [your email].

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have set up the project by following the [Getting Started Guide](./getting-started.md).

### Finding Issues to Work On

- Look for issues labeled with `good first issue` for newcomers
- Check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/[your-username]/[project-name]/issues) for existing bugs and feature requests
- Feel free to ask for clarification on any issue before working on it

## Development Workflow

### 1. Fork and Clone the Repository

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/[project-name].git
   cd [project-name]
   ```

3. Add the original repository as an upstream remote:

   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/[original-owner]/[project-name].git
   ```

### 2. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name  # for features
# or
git checkout -b bugfix/your-bugfix-name    # for bugfixes
```

Use a descriptive name for your branch that reflects the changes you're making.

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

1. Make sure your Flutter SDK is up to date:

   ```bash
   flutter upgrade
   ```

2. Get all dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Run any code generators if the project uses them:

   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build
   ```

### 4. Make Your Changes

- Follow the [Dart and Flutter Coding Standards](#dart-and-flutter-coding-standards) outlined below
- Write tests for your changes when applicable
- Update documentation if necessary
- Run linters and formatters before committing:

  ```bash
  flutter analyze
  flutter format .
  ```

### 5. Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly update your branch with changes from the upstream main branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

Resolve any merge conflicts that arise.

## Pull Request Process

### 1. Create a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Go to the original repository on GitHub
3. Click "New Pull Request"
4. Select your branch and fill out the PR template

### 2. PR Requirements

Ensure your PR meets these requirements:

- The code builds without errors
- All tests pass (`flutter test`)
- Code has been analyzed (`flutter analyze`)
- New code has appropriate test coverage
- Documentation is updated
- Code follows project style guidelines
- Commit messages follow guidelines

### 3. PR Review Process

1. Maintainers will review your PR
2. Address any requested changes
3. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your PR
4. Your contribution will be part of the project!

## Dart and Flutter Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow Dart best practices and conventions
- Keep functions and methods small and focused
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments only where necessary to explain complex logic

### Dart Style Guide

- Follow the [official Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)
- Use `lowerCamelCase` for variables and methods
- Use `UpperCamelCase` for classes, enums, and typedefs
- Use `snake_case` for file names
- Keep line length to a maximum of 80 characters

### Flutter Best Practices

- Extract reusable widgets to separate classes
- Keep widget trees clean and manageable
- Follow the recommended Flutter architecture pattern ([Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider), [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc), etc.)
- Use `const` constructors when possible to improve performance
- Follow accessibility guidelines

### Code Organization

- Structure files logically in directories:

  ```plaintext
  lib/
  ├── api/          # API related code
  ├── models/       # Data models
  ├── providers/    # State management
  ├── screens/      # UI screens
  ├── utils/        # Utilities
  └── widgets/      # Reusable widgets
  ```

- Keep related functionality together
- Follow consistent naming patterns for files and directories

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types include:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code functionality (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:

```plaintext
feat(auth): add biometric authentication
fix(ui): resolve overflow in profile screen
docs: update installation instructions
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Widget Tests**: Test UI components
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete features or workflows

### Writing Tests

- Create test files with the `_test.dart` suffix
- Place tests in the `test/` directory matching the structure of `lib/`
- Test both normal cases and edge cases
- Mock dependencies to isolate the code under test
- Use descriptive test names:

  ```dart
  test('should show error message when login fails', () {
    // Test code
  });
  ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run a specific test file
flutter test test/path/to/test_file.dart

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage
```

## Documentation Guidelines

- Update documentation for any feature, API change, or other significant modification
- Write clear, concise, and comprehensive documentation
- Use proper Markdown formatting
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Add dartdoc comments to public APIs:

  ```dart
  /// Returns the user's profile information.
  /// 
  /// Throws a [NetworkException] if the network request fails.
  Future<UserProfile> getUserProfile() async {
    // Implementation
  }
  ```

- Check spelling and grammar

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

1. A clear, descriptive title
2. Steps to reproduce the issue
3. Expected behavior
4. Actual behavior
5. Screenshots (if applicable)
6. Device information:
   - Device model
   - Operating system version
   - Flutter version (`flutter --version`)
7. Any additional context that might be helpful

### Suggesting Features

For feature suggestions:

1. Describe the feature clearly
2. Explain why this feature would be useful
3. Provide examples of how the feature would work
4. Consider including mockups if it's a visual feature
