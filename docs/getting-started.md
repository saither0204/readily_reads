## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository URL]

# Navigate to the project directory
cd [project-directory-name]
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to the Flutter app directory
cd mobile

# Get Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# If you have a backend
cd ../server
npm install  # or yarn install
cd ..
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

#### Mobile App Environment

1. Create a `.env` file in the `mobile` directory (if using environment variables)
2. Add the required environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   API_URL=[backend API URL]
   API_KEY=[API key if required]
   # Add other app-specific environment variables
   ```

3. If using `flutter_dotenv` or similar, make sure to update your `pubspec.yaml` to include the `.env` file:

   ```yaml
   assets:
     - .env
   ```

#### Server Environment (if applicable)

1. Navigate to the `server` directory
2. Create a `.env` file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env  # If .env.example exists
   ```

3. Fill in the required environment variables:

   ```plaintext
   # Server Configuration
   PORT=[your port number]
   NODE_ENV=[development/production]

   # Database Configuration
   DB_URI=[your database connection string]

   # Authentication
   JWT_SECRET=[your JWT secret]
   JWT_EXPIRY=[token expiry time]

   # [Any other configuration variables]
   ```

### 4. Configure Firebase (if applicable)

1. Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Add Android and iOS apps to your Firebase project
3. Download and place the configuration files:
   - For Android: `google-services.json` in `mobile/android/app/`
   - For iOS: `GoogleService-Info.plist` in `mobile/ios/Runner/`
4. Follow Firebase setup instructions for Flutter in the [FlutterFire documentation](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview)

### 5. Set Up the Database (if applicable)

1. [Instructions for starting your database]
2. [Instructions for creating a database]
3. [Instructions for running migrations, if applicable]:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run migrate  # or yarn migrate
   ```

### 6. Starting the Development Environment

```bash
# Start the backend server (if applicable)
cd server
npm run dev  # or yarn dev

# In a new terminal, start the Flutter app
cd mobile
flutter run
```

### 7. Running on Devices/Emulators

#### Android Emulator

1. Open Android Studio
2. Open AVD Manager (Tools > AVD Manager)
3. Create a virtual device if you don't have one
4. Start the emulator
5. Run `flutter run` from the terminal

#### iOS Simulator (Mac only)

1. Open Xcode
2. Open Simulator (Xcode > Open Developer Tool > Simulator)
3. Select a device (File > Open Simulator)
4. Run `flutter run` from the terminal

#### Physical Devices

1. Connect your device via USB
2. Enable USB debugging (Android) or trust the computer (iOS)
3. Run `flutter devices` to verify the device is detected
4. Run `flutter run` to install and launch the app

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality

1. **Linting**:

   ```bash
   # Run Flutter linting
   cd mobile
   flutter analyze
   ```

2. **Formatting**:

   ```bash
   # Format Dart code
   cd mobile
   flutter format lib/
   ```

3. **Testing**:

   ```bash
   # Run Flutter tests
   cd mobile
   flutter test

   # Run backend tests (if applicable)
   cd server
   npm test  # or yarn test
   ```

### Git Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name  # or bugfix/your-bugfix-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them with meaningful messages:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of the changes"
   ```

3. Push your branch to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request on GitHub (or your Git platform)

## Building for Release

### Android

1. Create a keystore:

   ```bash
   keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/upload-keystore.jks -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias upload
   ```

2. Create `mobile/android/key.properties` file:

   ```plaintext
   storePassword=<password from previous step>
   keyPassword=<password from previous step>
   keyAlias=upload
   storeFile=<location of the key store file, such as ~/upload-keystore.jks>
   ```

3. Update `mobile/android/app/build.gradle` to use the keystore for signing

4. Build the APK or App Bundle:

   ```bash
   # For APK
   flutter build apk

   # For App Bundle (Google Play)
   flutter build appbundle
   ```

### iOS (Mac only)

1. Open the project in Xcode:

   ```bash
   cd mobile/ios
   open Runner.xcworkspace
   ```

2. Configure signing in Xcode:
   - Select the Runner project in the navigator
   - Select the Runner target
   - Select the Signing & Capabilities tab
   - Choose your team and manage certificates

3. Build the app:

   ```bash
   flutter build ios
   ```

4. Archive the app in Xcode for distribution
