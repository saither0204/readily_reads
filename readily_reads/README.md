## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (version: [specify version])
- Dart (version: [specify version])
- Android Studio or Xcode (for emulators)
- [Any other dependencies]

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the mobile directory
cd mobile

# Get all dependencies
flutter pub get
```

### Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the mobile directory (if using environment variables)
2. Add the following environment variables:

```plaintext
API_URL=[backend API URL]
APP_VERSION=[application version]
# Add other app-specific environment variables
```

**Note**: You'll need to use a package like `flutter_dotenv` to load these variables.

## Available Commands

### Running the App

```bash
# Run in debug mode on connected device or emulator
flutter run

# Run with specific device
flutter run -d [device_id]

# Run with flavor (if configured)
flutter run --flavor [flavor] -t lib/main_[flavor].dart
```

### Building the App

```bash
# Build APK (Android)
flutter build apk

# Build app bundle for Play Store
flutter build appbundle

# Build for iOS
flutter build ios

# Build with flavor
flutter build apk --flavor [flavor] -t lib/main_[flavor].dart
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/unit/example_test.dart

# Run with coverage
